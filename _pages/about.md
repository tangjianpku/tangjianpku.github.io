I am currently an associate professor at [Mila-Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.umontreal.ca/en/) and [HEC Montreal](http://www.hec.ca/). Prior to that, I was a Postdoc at University of Michigan and Carnegie Mellon University. I also worked at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) as an associate researcher between 2014-2016. For more information, please check my [CV](https://github.com/tangjianpku/tangjianpku.github.io/blob/master/files/CV/CV_2022.June.pdf).

<span style="color:red">Hiring!!</span> Our group has multiple PhD positions next Fall. In particular, we are looking for students to work on the following projects:

* Geometric Deep Learning, Graph Neural Networks for Drug Design
* Equivariant Neural Networks for Molecular Simulation
*  Knowledge Graph Construction and Reasoning, Natural Language Understanding


Students who are interested in working with me please apply through [Mila admission](https://mila.quebec/en/admission/) (students working with me will be affiliated with UdeM) or send me an email directly.
