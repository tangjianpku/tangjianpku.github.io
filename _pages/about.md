I am currently an associate professor at [Mila-Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.umontreal.ca/en/) and [HEC Montreal](http://www.hec.ca/). Prior to that, I was a Postdoc at University of Michigan and Carnegie Mellon University. I also worked at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) as an associate researcher between 2014-2016. For more information, please check my [CV](https://github.com/tangjianpku/tangjianpku.github.io/blob/master/files/CV/CV_2022.June.pdf).

<span style="color:red">Hiring in 2025 Fall!!</span> Our group has multiple PhD positions in Fall 2025. In particular, we are looking for students to work on the following two directions:

* Geometric Deep Learning, Generative Models (e.g., diffusion models, flow matching) for drug discovery, in particular protein design;
  
* Large Language Models (LLMs) for Multiomics (genomoics, single-cell RNA-seq, proteomics, etc.).

* Building Generative Agent for Biomedical Applications with LLMs. 

We are collaborating with many leading labs in biology across the world and have access to big GPU clusters through our industry collaborators. Join us to make imact in tacking real-wold challenging biological problems with generative AI. 


Students who are interested in working with me please apply through [Mila admission](https://mila.quebec/en/prospective-students-and-postdocs/research-programs/request-supervisor) (students working with me will be affiliated with UdeM) or send me an email directly through tangjian@mila.quebec
