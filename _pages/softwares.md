* **GraphVite**: a scalable and high-performance graph embedding system developed from scratch covering three different types of applications including node embedding, knowledge graph embedding, and graph and high-dimensional data visualization. Released at Github since 2019.8, with over 800 stars. ([source code](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/graphvite))
* **Recommender Systems**: a Tensorflow library of deep learning for recommender systems including sequential recommendation, feature-based recommendation and social recommendation. Released at Github since 2019.03, with over 700 stars. ([source code](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/RecommenderSystems))
* **Knowledge Graph Embedding**: a PyTorch implementation of the RotatE model for knowledge graph embedding (KGE). We provide a toolkit that gives state-of-the-art performance of several popular KGE models. Released at Github since 2019.01, with over 600 stars.
